    <h2>About</h2>
     <p>My name is Sevinj and I am currently studying Computer Programming at Seneca College. My main goal for now is to gain more knowledge,  expand it and use in my future works. </p>
          <p>I've never been interested in technology before and coding was quite scary for me. However, after practising HTML/CSS for the first time, I saw a magic and fell in love. As a hobby artist, Website design and colors attracted me a lot and I decided to go for it. </p><br>
          <p>My first experience with Javascript was extremely challenging and I realized that this way is going to be harder than i think. But I'm trying my best to build a strong foundation of Javascript, to be successful and create incredible stuff. </p>
          <p>This choice turned to a passion and I have huge plans which gives me a good vibe.</p>
